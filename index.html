            <p>A platform where youth can share their voices with the world, you matter!! What do you have to say? We want to hear it! There have been so many times when my art and self-expression is the only thing that has brought me solace. When you share what you have created with the world and are celebrated for it you are reminded that you matter. We want to provide a platform where youth can use their artistic voice to empower each other. We are the generation of connection and connecting is what velocities humankind. Our goal is to take advantage of that connection and to take the voices of our generation; the art of our generation, and use it to change the world for better. Any work that is sent in will be published on our website and with artist permission will be sent to different literary and art publications nationwide so that all the voices of our generation will be given the opportunity to be celebrated.</p>
